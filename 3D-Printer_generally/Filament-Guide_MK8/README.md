Anet A3/A6/A8 Filament Guide

Like many others, I have come to the conclusion that it is not possible to print TPU on an Anet printer without preparations. As expected, I found solutions to my problem on Thingiverse. Once again, the solutions didn't fit my printer perfectly. 
And so I started to design again, based on the solutions of [MasterFX](https://www.thingiverse.com/MasterFX/about), [Bomber0](https://www.thingiverse.com/Bomber0/about) and [Leo_N](https://www.thingiverse.com/Leo_N/about). With the offered STL files I have noted deviations to my printer in the tenth to millimeter range, which is too much deviation with such a delicate constellation.
I marked this thing as a remix because of the sources mentioned above, although I redesigned it from scratch.
