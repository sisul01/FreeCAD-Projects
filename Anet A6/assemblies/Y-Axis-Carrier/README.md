Anet A6/A8 Y-Axis-Carrier assembly
==================================
Because my [Anet A6/A3 printhead assembly](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3364130) was downloaded so many times, I decided to upload the Y-axis carrier as well.
I also created this to check my desings for parts that are attached to the carrier, for example my [Anet A6/A8 heatbed cable holder/ strain relief](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3477066).
The STL-files are to be understood again more as illustrative objects, since practically all parts are made of metal
The FreeCAD models are enclosed in two zipped files, on the one hand as complete models to which own adaptations can be made and on the other hand as simplified models, which can be used in own assemblies.
