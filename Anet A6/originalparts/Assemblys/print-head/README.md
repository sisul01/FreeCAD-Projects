Anet A6 printhead assembly
==========================

I want to make some changes to the printhead assembly of my printer. I have created the complete, original printhead assembly so I can check my designs before printing. The STL files are therefore rather intended as illustrative objects. Except the acrylic parts, which can be used for the printing of spare parts immediately.
The FreeCAD models are enclosed in two zipped files, on the one hand as complete models to which own adaptations can be made and on the other hand as simplified models, which can be used in own assemblies.

The assembly consists of:
_Metal_parts:_
* Aluminium Sled
* Aluminium Heater Block
* Nozzle 0.4mm
* Teflon Throat Tube 40mm
* Extruder MK8
* Fan Grill
* Heat-Sink

_Electronic_parts:_
* 5015 Centrifugal Fan
* Heat-Sink Fan
* Stepper-Motor Nema 17 - 38mm
* Endstop Switch

_Acrylic_parts:_
* Centrifugal Fan Holder
* EndswitchX-Holder

_3D_printed_parts:_
* Fan Duct

All components have been measured on my printer, therefore it can lead to differences with other printers.
