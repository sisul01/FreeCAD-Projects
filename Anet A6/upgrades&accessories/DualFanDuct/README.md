I have noticed time and again in my prints that the parts did not have the same quality on all sides and have attributed this to the one-sided cooling.
The round and semicircular models didn't convince me although they likely work. But I wanted a model that didn't obstruct my view of the nozzle from the front.
So after some failures this two sided model was made. 
It is probably not suitable for A6 models with the original Z-carriers, because in X+ direction the channel protrudes a little.

The printing is a little complicated, because the nozzles protrude downwards. Unfortunately the construction was not possible for space reasons otherwise. I tried to move the nozzle mouths flush with the underside of the duct, but then it was not possible to construct the nozzles functionally.
I didn't want to pull down the bottom of the channel because I want to leave space for glass bed clamps.
With the large bends I noticed a strong warping, so that I have inserted 6 adhesion points into the .stl-file, which must be removed after the printing.
I reduced the printing speed to 40mm/s to print the bridges properly.
