Anet A6 extruder/hotend cable holder
====================================

After I created the [Hot-End Assembly](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3364130) it was time to make something out of it. First I designed a cable holder for the extruder/hot end. 

It leads the cable bundle 30 degrees to the left and 45 degrees to the top. So there should be less jammed cables when the extruder moves to the home position in a higher Z position.
The cables are attached to the holder with 2 cable ties.
There is a slot for the centrifugal fan so that the fan can be aligned vertically. I had the problem with the original holder that the fan could not be aligned correctly due to inaccuracies and was always a little misaligned.
