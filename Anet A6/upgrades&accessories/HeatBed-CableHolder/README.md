Anet A6/A8 heatbed cable holder/ strain relief
==============================================

I have never really liked the design of the cable connection on the heatbed. Due to the movement, the plug always wobbles up and down a little.
But I didn't want to solder the cables, because I wanted to keep an easy way to disconnect the heating bed for maintenance/conversion work. 
The present holder is kept very simple. It picks up the cable behind the plug and eliminates the forces on the cable caused by the movements. For maintenance work only the cable tie, which fixes the cable to the holder, has to be cut.
The whole thing should be a little more stable, but unfortunately the possibilities for attaching the holder are quite limited. For the moment this solution is sufficient, I couldn't see any more wobbling of the plug.
