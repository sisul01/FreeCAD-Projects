Mainboard, MOSFET and Smoother Holder
=====================================

There were already some holders for the mainboard and/or Mosfet, but I also wanted to fit the TL Smoothers, so I designed this part for my Anet A6 printer.
There is certainly room for improvement, but it works in this version.

Additionally 4x M3x16 screws are needed to screw the holder to the acrylic housing and another 28 sheet-metal screws 2.9x9.5mm to screw the electronic parts to the holder.

**_Edit V1.1:_**
I reinforced the holders for the mainboard, they were too weak in the first version.
I think I'll leave the Holder in this form now. But you are welcome to do a remix, the FreeCAD file is here.
