Mainboard, MOSFET and Smoother Holder
=====================================

There were already some holders for the mainboard and/or Mosfet, but I also wanted to fit the TL Smoothers, so I designed this part for my Anet A6 printer.
There is certainly room for improvement, but it works.

Additionally 4x M3x16 screws are needed to screw the holder to the acrylic housing and another 28 sheet-metal screws 2.9x9.5mm to screw the electronic parts to the holder.
