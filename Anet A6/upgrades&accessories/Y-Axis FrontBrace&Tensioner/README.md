Anet A6 Y-Axis BackBrace & Tensioner
====================================

The back brace stabilises the acrylic frame and significantly reduces the wobbling of the z-axis.
I designed it to fit my front brace ([thing:3253243](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3253243)). Unfortunately I couldn't integrate the limit switch holder as this would have caused problems during assembly. You can use the original holder or the one I designed ([thing:3253991](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3253991))

The part is printed in PLA with a resolution of 0.2 mm, a wall thickness of 1.2 mm and a filling of 30%.
The brace should be printable without support-material except for the rear rectangular protrusions.
The original screws M3x18 can be used for the screws.
