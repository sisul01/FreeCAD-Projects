Anet A6 Y-Belt Holder
=====================

I enjoy designing things, then printing and seeing them working. That's why I decided to design my own Y-belt holder.

My aims were as follows:
- Height compensation, so that the belt runs parallel
- Belt can be mounted without tools
- Easy to mount
- Use of the original screws

The result is available in two versions, the 18mm version for the H-beam above and the 12mm version for the beam below.
I printed my holder relatively slowly and with good resolution because the tooth profile requires very tight tolerances. The belt should fit well, but it must not have to be strangled into the slot with brute force.

I don't use the original timing belt but one that is a few hundredths of a mm thinner. I've been printing for several hours now with the dimensions I've chosen, without even a slight shift in the belt.

__Edit 16.10.2018__
I've made some adjustments:
- Total height reduced by 1mm
- Belt holder placed 0.3mm higher
- Bottom edge rounded
- Belt center corrected
- FreeCadFile adapted for easier dimensional changes
