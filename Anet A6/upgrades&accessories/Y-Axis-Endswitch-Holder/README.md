Anet A6 Y-Axis-Endswitch-Holder
===============================

With my original acrylic switch holder, the holes for the mounting screws are a little to big, so that the end switch moved during operation. Therefore I decided to design a new holder with a stop, so that the limit switch can't move anymore.
