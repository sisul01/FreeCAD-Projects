Anet A6 Y-axis belt tensioner
=============================

And here another Y-axis belt tensioner.

I was always a little unhappy about the screw of the tensioner protruding from the front. Then I found the inspiration in [Thing 2789229](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2789229) by FreezB for my design. But it's a completely new design, not a remix.

It was only supposed to be a proof of concept, because I wanted to integrate a tensioner into a Y-axis support plate. However, the result is a fully functional design that works perfectly in this form and looks reasonably good.

The parts with the threads should be printed in 0.1mm resolution, as the tolerances are relatively narrow. After printing, screw the two parts completely into each other once, then the thread should be OK.
