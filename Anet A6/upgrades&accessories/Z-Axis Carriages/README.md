Anet A6 Z-Axis Carriages
========================

The appearance of the A6 is rather angular. The designs of [jgbbob8](https://www.thingiverse.com/jgbbob8) [Anet A6 X Axis](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2106854) and [ejpsx](https://www.thingiverse.com/ejpsx) [x axis anet a6 final edition](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2043600) destroyed this concept with their striking round shapes. That's why I designed this version of the Z-axis carriage.

In the end only the idea and more or less the outer dimensions are left of the initial models, everything else I modified. So it is not possible to reuse existing parts, but everything has to be reprinted. That's why I didn't mark it as a remix, it's a complete reinterpretation of the basic idea.

In the design, I placed particular emphasis on form and function. In my opinion it simply looks better and the assembly should be a little easier than with the original models.

There are two versions of the tension wheel holder, one for a 3mm cylindrical pin and another with M3 screw. I prefer the version with the cylindrical pin, because after a certain time screws always caused me problems with the bearings of the idlers.

I calculated 0.3mm oversize for the 8mm bores, but it is possible that you still have to re-drill. They are also not continuously 8mm in diameter but in the middle part a little extended, so that the assembly of the guide rods should be easier.

The models are already oriented as I printed them. Support structures should only be used in the middle part, in the area of the 8mm holes they only lead to problems.

__I'd appreciate it if you'd post your makes here.__
