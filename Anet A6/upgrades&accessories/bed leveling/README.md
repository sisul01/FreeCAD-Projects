Bed Level Thumbwheel M3
=======================

Normal thumbwheels for hot bed-levelling with rounded knurls. 
I designed these to fit the knurled wheel of my Y-tensioner [thing:3253243](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3253243) and [thing:3045678](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3045678)
There are two versions available, one for a wing nut and one for a normal hex nut.
