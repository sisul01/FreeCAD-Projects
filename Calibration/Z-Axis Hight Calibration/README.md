Z-Axis Hight Calibration Tool
=============================

My 3D printer has 2 Z-axis motors that adjust the height of the X-axis. I was looking for a solution to align the two sides as easily as possible. The result is this support.

The support has an adjustment range of 96 - approx.160mm and a diameter of 36mm. 
So that the height can be adjusted as fine as possible, I have chosen a thread M24x1. This thread is at the same time self-locking, i.e. even with a load it does not move. To prevent accidental adjustment, the height can be secured with a lock nut.

It is not very easy to print, on the one hand the tolerances are very narrow and on the other hand the thread is relatively long. The resolution for printing should therefore be max. 0.1mm and the printer should be well calibrated. I recommend a test print of nut and bolt.
