Z-Axis Sync indicator
=====================

During bed levelling or filament changing it happens to me again and again that I inadvertently adjust the height of the X-axis on one side.
So that I have a display for such a behavior, I designed these parts.

It should fit many printers with 2 Z-axis motors. Maybe the size of the index ring has to be adjusted slightly.
