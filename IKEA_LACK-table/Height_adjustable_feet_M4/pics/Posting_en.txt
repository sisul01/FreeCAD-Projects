Invisible stacking connectors for IKEA-LACK table

For my 3D printer I build a housing with the IKEA-LACK tables. To do this, they must be stacked on top of each other in a non-slip manner. There are already many different methods to solve this problem on Thingiverse, but only a few that would have satisfied me from the optical point of view.
My design goals for this project were the following: 
As invisible as possible, non-slip connection, easy assembly, should be dismountable without tools.

The chosen solution requires some effort in the preparation, but is completely invisible. To do this you have to hollow out the table legs, which is usually relatively simple, since the chipboards used are only 1cm - 1.5cm thick and quite crumbly. If you are unlucky, however, a 3.5cm plate of more stable material is glued in.
I think that the effort is still worthwhile and the result speaks for itself.
