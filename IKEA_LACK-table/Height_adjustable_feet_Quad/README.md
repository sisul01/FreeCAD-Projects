Height adjustable feet for IKEA LACK table
==========================================

I was not satisfied with my first design of the height-adjustable feet ([thing:3035217](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3035217)). Technically they work fine, but optically it looks strange.

I also wanted to put the table on wheels, which wasn't possible with the existing feet. New feet had to be added. They should have a square base to which one can attach wheels, but still be height adjustable. This is how the current model came into being.

As with my version 2 of the first design, the legs must be completely hollowed out at the bottom. This is in most cases relatively simple, but sometimes there is a more stable version of a block at the leg end, which then requires a little more work.

_Common Printer Settings:_
Material: PLA
Resolution: 0.2mm
Wall thickness: 1.2mm
Infill: 20%-50%

**Flange**
-------
This part is inserted into the table legs. If you like, you can glue them in, but I didn't do that.

_Additional parts:_
none

_Printer Settings:_
Infill: 30%
Support: yes
Adhesion: Skirt


**HolderPlate**
-----------
This plate secures the adjusting wheel to the flange. I used self-tapping screws for screwing, because they hold well in the plastic and are easier to use than screws and nuts.

_Additional parts:_
4 x sheet metal screw 2.9 x 9.5 or 2.9 x 13

_Printer Settings:_
Infill: 20-30%
Support: no
Adhesion: none



**Slider and Wheel**
----------------
These two elements form the actual height adjustment. Here I used a metric fine thread M36 x 3. This looks a lot better than my first edition of the height-adjustable feet. 
The tolerances are relatively tight, but at the end there is an almost play-free fit. The first screwing together requires a certain amount of force until the unevenness of the printing has rubbed off each other. This is especially the case with a resolution of 0.2mm. A resolution of 0.1mm would be possible, but takes a very long time to print.
Finally, I screwed wheels with a hole distance of 29mm to the slider. But you can also do without it, but to protect a wooden floor you should glue felt pieces on it.

_Additional parts (only with additional wheels):_
4 x sheet metal screw 2.9 x 9.5 or 2.9 x 13

_Printer Settings:_
Infill: 30-50%
Support: no
Adhesion: Skirt
