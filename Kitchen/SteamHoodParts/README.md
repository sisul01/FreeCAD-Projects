Movable Hinge-Bolts for Steam-Hood
==================================

While cleaning my steam hood I broke 2 plastic hinge bolts. The steam extractor hood is an older model V-Zug type DA S-5. It would probably have been possible to order the spare parts from the manufacturer, but one can also make it on a 3D printer :-)

During the construction it was obvious that this is an injection moulded part, the shape is not particularly suitable for 3D printing.
I printed it in PETG, PLA would have become too stiff and I didn't want to use PLA because of the expected temperatures.
