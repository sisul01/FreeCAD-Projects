Pen-Holder for the kitchen cupboard
===================================

As soon as I run out of an ingredient while cooking, I like to put it on a shopping list immediately. I have attached a note with magnets to the kitchen cupboard. 
But I couldn't fix the corresponding pen like that. Therefore I designed this holder. Now the pin holds also when opening and closing the cabinet door.

- Additionally 2 round Neodym magnets 8x3 are needed.
