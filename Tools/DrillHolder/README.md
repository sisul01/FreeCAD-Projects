Drill Holder

Since I don't always want to use power tools to rework a hole, I was looking for a hand tool. I found inspiration at [Rasle500](https://www.thingiverse.com/Rasle500), [thing:16682](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16682) and at [aubenc]https://www.thingiverse.com/aubenc/about), [thing:16839](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16839). But the models did not suit me in the present form, they were too clumsy for me. A further weakness were the stuck collets, after one screwed tight.
Therefore I designed a completely new holder, where only the collets are compatible.
The holder is slimmer and has a diameter of 32mm and a length of 96mm. It also has an ejector that allows you to release tightly fitted collets with a light tap.

As always, the thread needs a few passes until the unevenness caused by the printing is smoothed off.

Edit 30.03.24:

At the request of a user, I have added collets with a diameter of 8.5mm to 10mm. However, I would like to add that in my opinion the mechanical stability and clamping force is no longer sufficient in all cases from diameters of approx. 6mm and higher. At best, the tool will slip in the collet during use, but overloading and material breakage can also occur.
 
I have also uploaded the corresponding step files.
