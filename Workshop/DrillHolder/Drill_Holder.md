Drill Holder

Since I don't always want to use power tools to rework a hole, I was looking for a hand tool. I found inspiration at [Rasle500](https://www.thingiverse.com/Rasle500), [thing:16682](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16682) and at [aubenc]https://www.thingiverse.com/aubenc/about), [thing:16839](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16839). But the models did not suit me in the present form, they were too clumsy for me. A further weakness were the stuck collets, after one screwed tight.
Therefore I designed a completely new holder, where only the collets are compatible.
The holder is slimmer and has a diameter of 32mm and a length of 96mm. It also has an ejector that allows you to release tightly fitted collets with a light tap.

As always, the thread needs a few passes until the unevenness caused by the printing is smoothed off.
