# Storage Drawer for Drill Holder

Since I had already made an [Ultimate Drawer System](https://www.thingiverse.com/make:644427) for my screws, it was obvious to create a drawer solution for the drill holder as well.
Since there is no suitable drawer in the system of [MarcElbichon](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2302575), I created a remix that suits me.
To prevent the chucks from sliding around loose, there is also a two-part insert. It can be simply plugged together.

__Printer settings:__
I have chosen the following settings:
Material: PLA
Resolution: 0.2mm
Wall thickness: 3 Perimeter
Top/Bottmom thickness: 3 Layer
Infill: 15-20%
Support: no
Build Plate Adhesion: Skirt
