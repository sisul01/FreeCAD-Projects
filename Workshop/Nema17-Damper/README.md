Nema17-Dampers
==============
I wanted to know if rubber dampers can be used in conjunction with Nema17 stepper motors. But I didn't want to wait for an order to be delivered, I wanted to try it out immediately. So I designed the dampers myself and printed them in TPU.
The result did not really convince me, the noise has become measurably quieter, but you don't hear much of it.
