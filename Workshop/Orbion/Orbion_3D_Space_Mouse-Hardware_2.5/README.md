### Version now available
- Hardware 2.5 (19/03/2022)
- Firmware 0.26.4 (19/03/2022)

All parts can be printed in the material of your choice (pay attention to the shrinkage factor of ABS and ASA), except for the "cuschio" and "wire_clips" parts which must be in TPU Shore 95A or 85A

Conf Example (Fusion 360)
- Set any key: SHIFT Key
- Set Joy Mode: Autodesk
- the other 3 buttons set them as you like

doing so by moving the knob you will get the orbit, while if you hold down the key you have mapped as "SHIFT key" and moving the knob at the same time you will get the PAN

# PAY ATTENTION

For problems caused by badly produced components and wrong heights due to the calibration of printers not created Tickets as they are unique problems and not attributable to the project.

To ensure greater precision and fluidity it is recommended to put a foam ring under the knob or Cushion_TPU and dielectric lubricant in the joystick!

If you notice that your joystick goes in different directions, you can change the direction, swapping the cables VRx and VRy or alternatively the variables horzPin and vertPin in the Settings.h

Before printing pay attention to the center distance of the encoder holes, 2 more diffuse sizes are available, 14mm and 17mm (file Enc_holder & Knob_axis)

I would like to point out that, if you use ABS it is good to know that some dimensions will not be correct if you do not take the usual precautions to the problem of shrinkage
In any case, make sure that your printer has the correct dimensional parameters
